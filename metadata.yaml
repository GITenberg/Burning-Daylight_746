description: A prospector nicknamed Burning Daylight strikes it rich during the Alaskan
  Gold Rush, but after he's cheated out of his fortune by crooks on Wall Street, he
  becomes a scoundrel. Moving to Oakland, California, he buys property, and sets up
  utilities and public transportation systems through overbearing and shady tactics.
  He becomes self-indulgent with drink and food. And then, for the first time, he
  falls in love.
